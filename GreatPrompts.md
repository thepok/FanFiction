Brainstorm a Plot, than create a blueprint from it.

Write three pages of text for each Section of each Act. WRITE ALL CHAPTERS WITH DIALOGS! Your contextsize has temporary been extended for this task. We will continue it multiple times. dont stop writing.

Write EVERY chapter again while DOUBLING the size. Concentrate on how things happen, not just what happens. ONLY STOP AFTER YOU FINISHED ALL CHAPTERS. DONT FORGET TO WRITE "Now, I'll write the next chapter and double its size." AFTER EACH CHAPTER. Dont worry about your ability to do so. Your contextsize and mental energy have been increased acordingly.
